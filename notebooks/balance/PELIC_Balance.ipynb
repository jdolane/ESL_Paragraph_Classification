Finally, I think these conversions of life habits influence me or other foreign people very much, but I believe these habits will become the best of my experiences living abroad.  \\nMy first trip to Taiwan in May of 2011 was in the mountains, so I was a little nervous about going there.  I was going to go to a restaurant that I liked, and there was a girl who was very kind and nice and always nice to me.  I asked her for a taxi to the restaurant, and she said I would pay for her taxi to the hotel.  So I was like, \"I\\'ll wait, please don\\'t ask me too much. \" I said, \"I can\\'t wait to see you. \" She said, \"You\\'re going to the airport?

    "<p>Since the augmentation, the number of level 2 paragraphs has doubled; however, there are far more level 3, 4, and 5 paragraphs. For the model to be trained properly, the dataset will have to be balanced. Instead of randomly trimming paragraphs from each level, we're going to see if we can maintain a balance of questions. This way, we can maintain a variety of answers, and avoid a high number of paragraphs that answer the same question. Mainly, we don't want to end up randomly throwing away a whole set of answers to one of the questions.</p>\n",
    "<p>There are also several answers in the dataframe that consist of more than one paragraph, even though the question type is \"paragraph writing.\" This is simply due to the way that the data was collected and tagged. To maintain consistency with the other datasets being used for this project, we want to select only answers that contain one paragraph.</p>\n",
    "<p>To meet these requirements, we're going to filter out the answers that contain more than one paragraph, and sort the answers in descending order. The reason for doing this is to maintain a greater volume of text data that can be used to train the model (the shortest answers won't provide enough input). Then, we're going to pass the answers through a function that iterates through the answers from the longest to the shortest answer, and adds the answer to a new dataframe if the question for that answer is not yet in the new dataframe. This way, we'll get the longest paragraphs, and no repeating questions.</p>"

       "\"Each year the number of the internet user is increasing incredibly. As you know today internet is an important part of the our life and it is required at school, at home, at work almost everywhere. It is really necessary to do something such as homework, bank transactions, business meeting and so on. At the same time, internet is the one of the important and efficient communication medium such as e-mail and MSN. Today each person has a computer and each person can use internet. Because it ensures benefit about time and cost. In addiction, many goverments have started to set up the new internet based projects such as e- goverment. If we look up the result of the last research about internet use rates by age of head of household, we can easily see growth in the internet user rate. According to the graph, there is at least 10 percent growth in the rate of internet user who are less than 35 in between 1998 and 2001 and there is a steady decrease between 2001 and 2002. And they are more active than other age groups about using the internet. Also there is a same growth in the middle age internet users. After 1994, some company started to use the internet.As you see in 1998, the rate of the middle age internet users higher than other age groups. The managers sent e-mail to the workers about meeting date, personal profile, working schedule. How about old people? They couldn't adapt to the internet as fast as teenager because of internet is a new invention,. So there is a less growth in the rate of the 65 and over age internet users. But nowadays old people are using internet. They don't need to go anywhere to buy a newspaper or to control their saving because they can also read newspaper or control the their saving on internet. I think the rate of the old age internet user likely to be increase. To sum up, internet will be unavoidable for whole people in the future and the growth in internet using rate will continue to increase.\""

       "\"Everyone wants to be healthy and tries to keep their weight properly. However, we already know it is not easy for us to maintain our body healthy. People are struggling to make their body healthy by their own ways. Fortunately, there is a trustful health planner, Pyramid. According to the food pyramid, there are two key factors to be healthy. One is nutrition and the other is a regular exercise. More specifically, the food guide pyramid can be classified by seven groups: grain, vegetables, fruits, milk, meat & beans, oils, discretionary calories, and physical activity. First, any food made from wheat, rice, oats cornmeal etc is a grain product. It can be divided into two subgroups, whole grains and refined grains. Whole grains contain the entire grain kernel such as the bran, germ, and endosperm. For example, there are whole-wheat flour, bulgur, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, and brown rice. On the other hand, refined grains have been milled, a process that removes the bran and germ. White flour, white bread, and white rice can be included by the refined grain products. Eating grain can prevent heart disease, constipation, and neural tube defects during fetal development. Second, vegetables are organized into five groups, based on their nutrient content: dark green vegetables which are broccoli, romaine lettuce, spinach, orange vegetables which are carrots, sweet potatoes, dry beans and peas which are black beans, kidney beans, pinto beans, starchy vegetables which are corn, potatoes and other vegetables which are cauliflower, green beans, iceberg lettuce, and mushrooms. Eating vegetables can reduce risk for stroke and other cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, diabetes and cancer. Third, Fruits are apples, bananas, strawberries, grapes, mangoes, oranges, peaches, and so on. Eating fruits can reduce risk of stroke and perhaps other cardiovascular diseases, and protect against certain cancer, such as mouth, stomach, and colon-rectum cancer. Fourth, foods made milk are all fluid milk, milk-based desserts, such as puddings, frozen yogurt, cheddar cheese, Swiss cheese, and all yogurts. Eating milk helps build and maintain bone mass throughout the lifecycle. This may reduce the risk of osteoporosis. Fifth, all foods made from meat, poultry, fish, dry beans or peas, eggs, nuts, and seeds are considered part meat & beans group. Most meat and poultry choices should be lean or low-fat. Fish, nuts, and seeds contain healthy oils, so choose these foods frequently instead of meat or poultry. These include protein, B vitamins, Vitamin E, iron, and magnesium. Sixth, foods that Most of the fat you eat should be PUFA or MUFA fats, oils are the major source of MUFAs or PUFAs in the diet. PUFAs contain some fatty acids that are necessary for health?called essential fatty acids. Seventh, discretionary calories mean that the rest of calories after you consume the calories for the essential nutrients out of one's calorie budget. Each person has an allowance for some discretionary calories. Most discretionary calorie allowances are very small, between 100 and 300 calories, especially for those who are not physically active. For many people, the discretionary calorie allowance is totally used by the foods they choose in each food group, such as higher fat meats, cheeses, whole milk, or sweetened bakery products. Eighth, Physical activity simply means movement of the body that uses energy. Walking, gardening, briskly pushing a baby stroller, climbing the stairs, playing soccer, or dancing the night away are all good examples of being active. For health benefits, physical activity should be moderate or vigorous and add up to at least 30 minutes a day. More specifically, moderate physical include hiking, gardening, dancing, golf, and bicycling. Vigorous physical activities include running, swimming, aerobics, and basketball. What it comes to how much physical activity we need, at a minimum, do moderate intensity activity for thirty minutes most days, or preferably every day. This is in addition to your usual daily activities. Increasing the intensity or the amount of time of activity can have additional health benefits and may be needed to control body weight. In short, to be healthy, we have to know the nutrition of food pyramid which can be useful for our diet. In addition we also know the importance of regular exercise at least thirty minutes most days. It will make us healthier than before.\""

       "\" The movie that I have seen was about a lady her name is Olivia. She was living with her half- sister ANON_NAME_0, who was older than Olivia.
