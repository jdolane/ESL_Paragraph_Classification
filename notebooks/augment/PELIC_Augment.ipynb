First of all, it's about my routine. I went to sleep late in Taiwan because I often had many works to need to do, but I always go to bed early here. I think my life in here is regular and normal, and I feel my body is healthy than before. Then, I never cooked except I didn't have money in my country, but now I cook two meals of one day here. I often sweep and clean up our apartment with my brothers here, but I only helped my mother to wash the dishes twice a month. Maybe I stayed at home very less, but I always love my mother until future. Second, it's about my diet. I drink a bottle of Coke one day here, but I didn't buy any soda in my country. Because the main of drink in Taiwan is fresh foam-tea, so I never drank another kinds of drinks like soda. Then, I liked to eat fruits before, but I can't buy it easy now. The fruits in U.S.A are more expensive than in Taiwan especially the banana. You could spend only 3 dollars to buy a string of bananas in my country, but the price of the same bananas cost about 6 dollar here.

I think my life in here is regular and normal, and I feel my body is healthy than before. Then, I never cooked except I didn't have money in my country, but now I cook two meals of one day here. I often sweep and clean up our apartment with my brothers here, but I only helped my mother to wash the dishes twice a month. Maybe I stayed at home very less, but I always love my mother until future. Second, it's about my diet. I drink a bottle of Coke one day here, but I didn't buy any soda in my country. Because the main of drink in Taiwan is fresh foam-tea, so I never drank another kinds of drinks like soda. Then, I liked to eat fruits before, but I can't buy it easy now. The fruits in U.S.A are more expensive than in Taiwan especially the banana. You could spend only 3 dollars to buy a string of bananas in my country, but the price of the same bananas cost about 6 dollar here.
